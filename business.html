We have a responsibility to our customers, employees and the communities in which we work, and we understand that economic growth must also be sustainable in order to be successful in the long run. We strive to minimize our environmental impact and contribute to the global transition to a low-carbon economy. We are aware of our social responsibility and adhere to high management standards. We are also aware of our responsibility for transparency and openness of our impact on people and the planet. Environmental We support the global transition to a low-carbon economy. We work to ensure the sustainability of our own operations and support our customers and their supply chains in reducing their own environmental impact. This includes ensuring the sustainability of the products and services we offer in areas such as capital markets, lending, banking, advisory services and investments. We also provide reliable climate risk management in sectors such as energy, palm oil production and forestry. Our sustainable financing goals We have committed to ensuring and encouraging sustainable financing and investments of US$100 billion between 2017 and 2025. We continue to make progress towards this goal, allocating $52.4 billion by the end of 2019. Our work in this area includes: advising clients and helping them gain access to capital markets; developing products such as environmental, social and sustainable bonds; providing loans for projects that meet environmental criteria; and managing socially responsible investment funds. Cumulative progress (billion US dollars) in sustainable financing By the end of 2019, we have reached $52.4 billion, our goal of securing and promoting sustainable financing and investments of $100 billion between 2017 and 2025. LandboBank maintains a high capital and liquidity balance, which significantly exceeds the minimum regulatory requirements. Customers Putting the customer at the center of everything we do is our top priority. But we understand that we need to go even further. We want to provide products and services that our customers need and that fit seamlessly into their lives. We invest in technology to improve their banking experience and maintain our standards in the fight against financial crimes. In 2019, 89% of our retail customers' transactions were conducted through mobile or online channels. We maintain trust by striving to protect customer data and information and ensure fair results for them. If something goes wrong, we know that we have to deal with complaints in a timely manner. Maintaining high standards of conduct is essential to our long-term success and strengthens our ability to serve our customers. As a client, you will have access to foreign currency accounts and international investment services. In addition, you will learn about options that may not be available in your country. Thanks to our execution-only service, we strive to follow your instructions in a timely and efficient manner. Workers We want to create an environment where everyone can realize their potential. That's why we prioritize the mental health of our employees, support their well-being, and recognize the importance of flexibility. For example, our global vacation policy helps people balance their work and personal lives. And in 2019, we started training all mental health managers to help them identify potential problems and guide people to the support they need. We need a diverse and inclusive workforce that values people and their contributions. This allows us to better represent our customers and the communities we serve. As part of this, we strive to ensure that women occupy at least 30 percent of our leadership positions. Given that 29.4% of senior positions were held by women at the end of 2019, we continue to make progress, but we still have to make progress. Communities We have a responsibility to invest in the long-term prosperity of the communities in which we operate. We recognize that technology is evolving at a rapid pace and that a range of new and excellent skills are now required to achieve success in the workplace. For this reason, we pay great attention to programs that promote employment and financial opportunities. We also support initiatives aimed at supporting responsible business and facilitating disaster relief efforts, depending on needs. In addition, we provide our employees around the world with various volunteering opportunities. Control We strive to conduct our business in accordance with high management standards. This includes working with our regulators to ensure the safety of the financial system and learning from past events so that they do not happen again. We fulfill our obligations to society by paying taxes and are transparent in our approach to them. We understand the role that businesses must play in protecting human rights and strive to ensure compliance with international standards in the workplace and supply chains. In addition, we recognize our broader commitment to society to expand access to financial services and are implementing a number of initiatives aimed at helping more people access financial services.

                    Customers
                    Putting the customer at the centre of everything we do is a priority. But we recognise we have further to go. We want to provide products and services that our customers need and that fit seamlessly into their lives. We are investing in technology to enhance their banking experience and maintain our standards in fighting financial crime. In 2019, 89 per cent of our retail banking customers’ transactions were conducted via mobile or online channels. We maintain trust by striving to protect customers’ data and information, and delivering fair outcomes for them. If things go wrong, we know we must address complaints in a timely manner. Operating with high standards of conduct is central to our long-term success and underpins our ability to serve our customers.
                    Employees
                    We want to create an environment at that allows everyone to fulfil their potential. This is why we prioritise our employees’ mental health, support their wellbeing and recognise the importance of being able to work flexibly. Our global sabbatical policy, for example, makes it easier for people to balance their work commitments with their personal lives. And, in 2019, we started providing mental health education to all managers , helping them spot potential issues and point people towards the right support.
                    We want a diverse and inclusive workforce that values individuals and their contribution. This allows us to better represent our customers and the communities we serve. As part of this, we have a target to ensure at least 30 per cent of our senior roles are held by women. With 29.4 per cent of senior roles held by women at the end of 2019, we continue to make progress – but have further to go.
                    Communities
                    We have a responsibility to invest in the long-term prosperity of the communities where we operate. We recognise that technology is developing at a rapid pace and that a range of new and different skills are now needed to succeed in the workplace. For this reason, much of our focus is on programmes that develop employability and financial capability. We also back initiatives that support responsible business, and contribute to disaster relief efforts based on need. In addition, we provide a variety of volunteering opportunities for our employees around the world.
                    Governance
                    We are committed to running our business in a way that upholds high standards of governance.
                    This includes working with our regulators to manage the safety of the financial system, and learning from past events to ensure they do not happen again.
                    We meet our responsibility to society through paying taxes and are transparent in our approach to it. We understand the role that businesses have to play in protecting human rights, and seek to ensure we respect international standards in our workplace and supply chains.
                    Furthermore, we recognise our wider obligations to society to increase financial inclusion and are carrying out a number of initiatives to help more people access financial services.</p>
